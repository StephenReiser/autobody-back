### About

This is the backend for the autobody project. It is built with Node, MongoDB, and Express. The front end is built with react.

## Set up instructions

Navigate to the autobody-back directory. Run npm i to install dependencies. Make sure you have mongoDB running - this project assumes you have it running on port 27017 - if you do not, update line 23 in the server.js file with the correct port.
Once mongoDB is running, in a new tab, navigate to the autobody-back directory and run nodemon.
